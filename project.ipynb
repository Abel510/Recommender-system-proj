Future iterations could explore matrix factorization techniques or deep learning approaches to enhance prediction accuracy.\n- Evaluation Metrics: Our current metrics focus solely on rating prediction accuracy. Incorporating ranking-based metrics (e.g., Precision@k, Recall@k) and diversity measures could provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the system's performance.\n- Cold Start Problem: The current system may struggle with new users or movies. Implementing content-based features could help address this limitation.\n- Scalability: As the dataset grows, computational efficiency may become a concern.
